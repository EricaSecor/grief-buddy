# grief-buddy
This is where I'm going to gather my ideas for the grief buddy app.
It's a distraction app for anyone when grief is triggered. 
One path is like chat roulette but more like distraction roulette. 
another is hi-low-no energy levels (active, middling, and passive moods).
5 senses (with adaptive alternatives - MAYBE)
