# grief-buddy
Grief Buddy is the app I always needed but never had when my parents were diagnosed with (and lost their battles to) cancer. This is where I'm going to gather my ideas for the grief buddy app.
It's a distraction app for anyone when grief is triggered and those sad or scary thoughts are about to spiral out of control. The primary level will have three options to chosoe from: a high, low, or no energy level to best pair the grief-stricken user with the best distraction. The secondary level has virtual cubbies that randomize happy-distractions (Ex: FRIENDS bloopers on YouTube, Live puppy cams, Local event/farmers market finder, etc). 
There will also be direct links to and suggestions for crisis help lines and live grief support.
